Answer the following questions for each of the data structures you implemented as part of this project.

## Queue

1. What is the runtime complexity of `enqueue`?
   Constant. It only adds 1 item to the Linked List and assignment is independent of queue size.

2. What is the runtime complexity of `dequeue`?
   Constant. It only removes 1 item from the Linked List and assigning the new start value is independent of queue size.

3. What is the runtime complexity of `len`?
   Constant. It doesnt need to do any counting, just retrieve a stored property of the class.

## Binary Search Tree

1. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `contains`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?

## Heap

1. What is the runtime complexity of `_bubble_up`?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `_sift_down`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `insert`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `delete`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `get_max`?

## Doubly Linked List

1. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_after`?

2. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.insert_before`?

3. What is the runtime complexity of `ListNode.delete`?

4. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_head`?

5. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_head`?

6. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.add_to_tail`?

7. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.remove_from_tail`?

8. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_front`?

9. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.move_to_end`?

10. What is the runtime complexity of `DoublyLinkedList.delete`?

    a. Compare the runtime of the doubly linked list's `delete` method with the worst-case runtime of the JS `Array.splice` method. Which method generally performs better?
